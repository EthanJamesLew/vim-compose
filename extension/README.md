# Vim Compose -- extension

This directory contains the source code for the Vim Compose extension.
To build, run the following:

```
npm install
npm run build-gecko # firefox
npm run build-chrome # chrome
```

The generated extension code will be in a subdirectory of `dist`, e.g. `dist/gecko` for firefox.
